# pi_setup

## What is this?
This is a project I'm working on to setup my raspberry pi. I enjoy the raspberry pi as a development platform, but I've always had trouble understanding the state of the operating system at the end of projects as I often change configurations without documenting my changes. Through this playbook I aim to configure the pi for various services/programs I want as a sort of main configurator.
